# Ghughariyo Mahajani Unicode font

A Unicode font for the [Mahajani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahajani) script developed by Idclang as a part of the 'Eḻuttu Revival' programme. The name Ghūghariyo given as the letters appeared to be looking like small round bells. 
The Mahajani script is quite distinct from other Brahmic scripts, as it doesn’t make use of vowel diacritics.

The font is available in regular style with OpenType (OTF) format and WebFont (WOFF2). The TrueType version includes regular and semi-bold styles.

Older versions of Unicode may not support the font, so make sure that you update to the recent Unicode version.
